# Welcome.
This is a stream about thinking, learning, and the exploration of subjects I'm interested in. If you choose to engage, know that you may get dunked on by someone else in the comments. If that happens, be sure to return the favor, but in a polite, charitable manner. After all, we're all just here to think, and thinking is quite the silly thing in the larger context of the universe.

# Creativity is about being in motion.

Am I creative? What evidence do I have for feeling like I am a creative person? Who do I know that is creative? How do they know they are creative? etc. etc. Questions that I have.
An oft described concept is the idea of a ["creativity faucet."](https://twitter.com/Julian/status/1327765347936522240?s=20) Imagine a pipe, one that is attached to a creative source:

The creativity tank has magic juice inside that you want to access. It will make you brilliant upon ingestion. However, the system as it stands is like this:

When the faucet hasn't been opened in a bit, the remaining juice in the pipe goes bad. It requires draining before the juice can be had again. However, you don't know when the garbage ends and the magic starts. To ensure you get some magic, you must not judge what initially comes out of the faucet. Anything that comes out could be magic juice, after all â€” you don't know how much garbage is in the pipe. Therefore, to generate consistent insight, the faucet must always be open. There will be times where the magic juice isn't suited to the project at hand, and that is okay. It can be discarded. The creativity tank is infinite. Your focus and circumstances are what determine the quality of ideas in this model, not your judgements.

While this model is useful after the start of the writing process, it's not as useful in generating ideas initially. It requires a pull, as if the garbage in the pipe is clogging it. For the most part, nothing will come out of the faucet unless there's some action that dislodges the garbage. Because of this, I try to keep the garbage as soupy as possibly in order
